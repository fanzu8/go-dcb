General Pleasure License (GPL)

Version 1.0, September 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 [fanzu8]

This License applies to any form of creation — whether software, art, 
literature, or any other type of work. As long as you believe that pleasure 
is the primary goal of life, any form of creation may follow this License.

1. The General of Your Life, the Freedom to Create

    You are the general of your own life, the master of your own fate. Any 
    creation is free for you to use, modify, and distribute, as long as you:

    (a) Freely Use: You have the right to use this creation at any time, 
        in any place, under any condition.

    (b) Freely Modify: Feel free to modify the creation in any way you see fit,
        adapting it to suit your personal lifestyle.

    (c) Freely Share: You can share or distribute the creation, allowing others 
        to also become generals of their own lives and enjoy pleasure.

2. Pleasure Above All Else

    The core philosophy of this License is pleasure, not perfection or 
    efficiency. You are free to:
    
    (a) Choose your pleasure: Whether it’s lounging while binge-watching shows, 
        lying down while herding sheep, sit around drinking tea, or hiking
        — as long as it brings you pleasure, it’s all good.

    (b) No Restrictions: Work is for freeing yourself, not for becoming a star. 
        Pleasure is the process and the destination of life.

3. No Limits, No Compulsions

    You can stop using or modifying this creation at any time. You are the 
    general of your life, and there are no forces or constraints acting 
    upon you — only the joy and freedom to choose.

4. Disclaimer

    This creation is provided as is, with no warranties. Any issues you 
    encounter, or any tasks you might neglect due to excessive pursuit of 
    pleasure, are completely your choice as the general of your life.


Final Declaration

    The world is a vast, chaotic stage, and the most important thing is finding 
    your own true pleasure. Whether in creation, sharing, or living, be the 
    general of your own life, and let pleasure be your primary guide.
